# About Me

Hello! ðŸ‘‹ I'm Aidan Flaherty, a Sophomore at Ohio University studying Management Information Systems and Data Analytics with a passion for Technology! 

## Background

My freshman year, I majored in Computer Science, gaining foundational knowledge in programming languages such as Python and C++. I also explored aspects of electrical engineering, developing a solid understanding of binary systems and circuit construction.
However, I later shifted my focus to Management Information Systems (MIS) with a minor in Data Analytics. This transition allowed me to combine my technical background with business insights.

## Current Focus

I am currently working on getting an internship for the summer of 2024! Outside of my academic curriculum, I am actively working on expanding my skills in SQL and delving deeper into the capabilities of Tableau. 

## Skills

- **Programming:** Basics of Python and C++
- **Data Analysis:** Basics of Excel and creating insightful Tabular charts
- **Database:** Currently gaining experience in SQL for effective data management
- **Visualization:** Working on enhancing proficiency in Tableau for impactful data visualization

## Projects

While I currently don't have personal projects to showcase, I am eager about applying my knowledge in practical ways. As I advance in my Excel course, I plan to create engaging data visualizations, and I'm in the process of studying SQL to undertake exciting 
database projects. Stay tuned for updates on my GitHub!

## Intrests

I am very interested in gaining more knowledge of technology that makes our jobs easier. I believe in working smarter, not harder! 

Beyond the tech world, I enjoy an active lifestyle. You can often find me in the gym, lifting weights to stay fit and healthy. I'm also a sports enthusiast, always cheering for my favorite teams, the Steelers and the Celtics!
